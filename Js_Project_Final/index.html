<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>My name is Charles Ballew, and this is my class Javascript project final.</p>
<p>My project will attempt to show an HTML form, an API of a map, a search or filter section of images, and an introduction page (this page actually) while using Javascript and jQuery.</p>
<p>In my Javascript class, CWB-205 at Front Range Community College, I have been pushed and pulled through several assignments dealing with Javascript.  I will submit that I have learned the bare bone basics of Javascript and the vastness of what I still need to learn.  As the class sailed through the Javascript basic instructions into functions, methods, and objects, I was feeling confident in my ability to accomplish the tasks required by the homework assignments.  It is when the class got more advanced in the code that I started to struggle.  I will admit there are a few areas that I was not able to figure out on my own.  The instructor gave the class the answer or I had to look up the answer elsewhere.  Going through the book a few more times will be needed before I can entertain the idea of calling myself a Javascript user let alone a coder.</p>
<p>I am intrigued and lured into Javascript through this class.  No doubt I will be using Javascript for the rest of my life.</p>
