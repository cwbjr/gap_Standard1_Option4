Greetings:


This has been a great class.  I spent hours on end trying to get things to work or respond to something, anything so that I know something worked.  That's just the homework throughout the course.  

My eyes have been open to JavaScript, and for that I am grateful.  This is one area I will be learning for the rest of my life, and I am glad for it.  

Here is my final project.  The best I was able to do.  Used things from the course book and things I figured out on my own.  I am happy with the results, but I will say there is much to improve upon.

Awesome class, Thank you.
